This is a learning project for finding port locations based on a given MAC address. 

The long term plan for this is to eventually have a script able to work out the port on a switch based on a given IP address and to even find the IP of a device on a port just based on the knowing the port number on the switch. 

The main goal of this project is to learn more about Python and interacting with Cisco IOS devices and Nexus devices.
